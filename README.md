# Breach App

A Flutter mobile application for staying informed about security news and real-time threat intelligence. This app provides users with a personalized experience to track events and read relevant articles.

## 🚀 Building and Deployment

### Automated Build Scripts

We've provided comprehensive build scripts to streamline your development workflow:

#### Mobile Build Script (`mobile_build.sh`)

The main script for building Android and iOS apps with advanced options:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x mobile_build.sh

# Build for both platforms (release)
./mobile_build.sh

# Build only Android
./mobile_build.sh --android-only

# Build only iOS
./mobile_build.sh --ios-only

# Build debug version
./mobile_build.sh --debug

# Build profile version
./mobile_build.sh --profile

# Clean build with custom version
./mobile_build.sh --clean --version=1.2.3 --build-number=123

# Skip tests and build
./mobile_build.sh --skip-tests
```

#### Script Features

- **Platform Selection**: Build for Android, iOS, or both
- **Build Types**: Debug, Release, Profile
- **Version Control**: Custom version and build numbers
- **Clean Builds**: Option to clean before building
- **Test Integration**: Runs tests before building (can be skipped)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and reporting
- **Colored Output**: Easy-to-read colored terminal output
- **File Location**: Shows where build files are located
- **File Sizes**: Displays APK/AAB sizes after building

### Manual Build Commands

#### Android Builds

```bash
# Debug APK
flutter build apk --debug

# Release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Profile APK
flutter build apk --profile

# Split APKs by architecture (recommended for Play Store)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release

# Android App Bundle (AAB) - Recommended for Play Store
flutter build appbundle --release

# Build with custom version
flutter build apk --release --build-name=1.2.3 --build-number=123
```

#### iOS Builds

```bash
# Debug build
flutter build ios --debug

# Release build
flutter build ios --release

# Profile build
flutter build ios --profile

# Build with custom version
flutter build ios --release --build-name=1.2.3 --build-number=123

# Archive for App Store (requires Xcode)
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```

### Build Output Locations

- **Android APK**: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`
- **Android AAB**: `build/app/outputs/bundle/`
- **iOS**: `build/ios/`



### Best Practices

1. **Version Management**: Always increment build numbers for new releases
2. **Build Variants**: Use flavors for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
3. **Code Signing**: Ensure proper code signing for production builds
4. **Testing**: Test builds on actual devices before distribution
5. **Documentation**: Keep build configurations documented and version controlled
